    <h2>To make chia seed pudding, you really only need two simple ingredients: chia seeds and milk, but there are some easy additions that will take the flavor up a notch.</h2>
    <p>There are a ton of chia seed recipes out there (and I have dozens posted here on EBF), but if you’re new to chia seeds, chia pudding is an awesome place to start because you’ll get a real sense of their absorption power, the gel-like texture chia seeds create and their ability to help keep you full.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chia seeds</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The process of making chia pudding is so easy! The first step is to stir together your chia seeds and milk in a mason jar or bowl. I usually do 3-4 Tablespoons of chia seeds to 1 cup of liquid.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is well combined, let it sit for 5 minutes, give it another stir/shake to break up any clumps of chia seeds, cover and put the mixture in the fridge to “set” for 1-2 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
